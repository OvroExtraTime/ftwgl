  <blockquote>Teams are currently ranked according to total points and differential. Use the selector to manually edit ranks as needed. For example, if two teams have the same points, but one has beaten the other in head-to-head play, then the victor should be ranked ahead of the loser regardless of differential.</blockquote>
